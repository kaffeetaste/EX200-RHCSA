IPv6

Question

On ServerB, add the following IPV6 address statically to your current running interface. Do this in a way that doesn’t compromise your existing settings:

    IPV6 – fd01::103/64

Overall explanation

You can check if IPV6 is enabled on your system using the following method:

Run the following command:

$ sudo sysctl -a | grep ipv6.*disable

A value of 0 indicates that IPv6 is active on your system.

Note that

    The command “sysctl” is used to manipulate kernel parameters at runtime, and the “-a” option shows all kernel parameters. The “grep” command filters the output and looks for lines containing the words "ipv6" and "disable".

    IPv6 is enabled by default on RHEL 9.

To add the IPV6 to the "enp0s3" interface, run:

1. To display the currently active network connections, run:

# nmcli con sh --active

2.

# nmcli con mod myprofile2 +ipv6.addresses fd01::103/64 ipv6.method manual

3. To reload NetworkManager configuration files without restarting the NetworkManager service, run:

# nmcli connection reload

OR

To bring up “myprofile2” network connection, run:

# nmcli con up myprofile2

4. To verify, use:

# nmcli dev sh enp0s3

OR

# nmcli con sh myprofile2
